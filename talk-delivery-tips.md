# Delivering presentations tips: timekeeping and more

Talks and presentations are a great tool. They allow you to bring to an
audience what excites you in an engaging and personal manner. An
audience that gives you immediate feedback - a lot of it in the form of
body language and reactions. To me, It is one of the most enjoyable and
interactive parts of being a developer advocate.

The start of any great presentation is excitement about the subject
matter. If you don\'t have that you might as well not be out there. We
already covered that a few times in this handbook. In this chapter I
want to cover a different problem of presenting. Keeping time and - more
importantly - keeping the audience interested.

The following information revolves around presentations at conferences.
Presentations that are your slot in the program and stand alone. Not
those introducing a workshop or during a company meeting. Many of the
things I will cover here are applicable to those, too, but there are
different nuances to take into consideration.

## How will I fit all of this in X minutes?

As someone who just starts out presenting, you will freak out about time
keeping - a lot. That\'s natural, that\'s also OK. We all do that.
People who just started presenting fall into two categories. Those who
rehearse every second of the talk and get derailed by disruptions and
those that appear far too fast in their delivery.

We tend to run up stairs rather than down them. The reason is that
stressful and tiring tasks appear easier when you get through them
quicker. That\'s also the reason why the delivery of your talk will
always be faster than the rehearsal or how you planned it. The
adrenaline rush you get from presenting on stage does that to you.
That\'s OK. It makes you human, approachable and brings the audience to
your side. You did the thing we all are scared of - presenting to a
group - and you are still scared of it. This makes you an honest,
technical presenter - not a slick and perfect actor or politician.

When you get more into the routine of presenting, this automatic
speeding up can become dangerous. The excitement doesn\'t wane - all you
do is getting used to being fast. That\'s why over time, your decks
become larger and you are tempted to add more and more to your talks.
You got time, so you might as well use that time, right? People should
get something for their money and more is always better, right?

## Less is more

**Don\'t fall into that trap**. A great talk makes only a few points all
amassing to one central theme. That\'s why conferences focused on
presenting have short talks. The 16-18 minutes TED imposes on talks is
not a trick to get more content. It is a great limit as this is the time
an audience is alert and able to take in things. It also forces the
presenters to think about their talks more: you have a limited time to
make your point. This means you will remove as much cruft and fluff as
you can. And you pick the more punchy and juicy bits of information.

This is something to remember: **start with a single point you want to
make**. This doesn\'t need to be a sound bite (although these are
important). It can be many things:

* It could be an insight.
* It could be a result of your research
* It could be a \"here\'s the current state of thing X\".
* It could be \"here\'s what\'s new in product X and how we build this
    functionality\".

Start with your point and then add the rest around it. Much like a good
story has a build-up, a climax and an aftermath, so should your
presentations. In essence, your focus should be **what do I want people
to remember of my talk?**. This means you need to try to get into the
heads of the audience a bit.

You know what you are talking about. Try to remember what was the main
\"A-hah!\" moment that got you to there. This is your starting point.
There is a reason why you are giving a presentation. The story you want
to tell about the topic of your talk is that reason. Not the topic
itself. You sell the topic - you don\'t have to own all the information.
This is important. There are a lot of presenters out there that tell you
all the steps to take to achieve a goal. But you'll remember those that
inspired you to learn more about the subject in your own way.

## Your talk is only extremely important to you

There are a few things we need to consider when we talk about technical
presentations to audiences at conferences:

* **Your talk is one of many** - if every presenter dazzles the
    audience with lots of live coding, great tools that make
    \"everything as easy as pressing a button\" and deep truths like
    \"methodology X is outdated, here is the new - if experimental -
    thing that will save us\" people are very quickly overwhelmed. It is
    refreshing to see a talk that makes one point well and doesn\'t look
    padded to appear more than it is. You can stand out by focusing on
    one thing.
* **Your talk is recorded and distributed** - there is a lot of
    research telling us how long educational videos should be and the
    general consensus is that shorter is better. People use
    browser-add-ons to watch videos faster than they are to save time.
    Nobody wants to spend a whole hour just to learn about some new
    product features.
* **People will not remember the whole talk** - you have to use the
    time you have to plant seeds. You want to have a few things people
    remember about your talk and make them come back to it or tell
    people about it.
* **People don\'t need you for information** - they need you for
    reflection. They need you to learn how to apply something or insight
    using various resources. Nobody needs you to tell them the obvious
    or things they could look up in a few seconds online.

Your job as a presenter is to make a topic interesting for people to try
it out themselves. You open the door, you lead the way, and then they
can spread out and find their own way around.

This is the true art of presenting. Stage time isn\'t show and tell
time. This is what video trainings, workshops, tutorials or one on one
trainings are about. Stage time at technical events is \"here is why
this is something worth your time looking into\". Or \"here is the state
of research - help us\" time. Not \"I know and I am so excited I will
show you everything I found\" time.

This can be tough to avoid as it is fun to show off on stage. It feels
good to share what you had to do to get somewhere. It is great to show
how effective using a certain tool or way of working makes you.

It is important to remember that people are not you, and everybody has a
different way of learning and working. Showing off what works for you
and how it makes you better can come across as condescending or
arrogant. Remember that the audience most likely know their stuff, too.
And they want to show off that they do. That\'s why you will get
aggressive feedback on social media during and after your talk when you
came across as too \"in your face\" with your product or your technical
knowledge.

## Map out more information

The simplest way to keep on time and use the time you have to bring
across the memorable messages is to delegate the information. Instead of
explaining everything yourself, you point to resources people can look
up in their free time. You can reference a few things this way:
* **Comparison/research sites on the web showing the current state of a certain technology**. These are great as it means your talk stays
    current. You introduce the audience to a resource to see the current
    state of affairs should they watch your talk recording later. There
    will always be a delay between your talk and the release as many
    conferences take a long time to edit and publish the videos. Don\'t
    show a current state, instead point to the ongoing journey.
* **In-depth talks that cover the same topic you offer as a solution**. Say you give a talk about offline applications. You
    could go into detail about all the browser differences and the state
    of service workers. Or you could point to a deep-dive talk on the
    subject matter and explain why this technology is important and what
    problem it solves. This also shows you as someone who cares about
    other presenters and conferences. It shows you care about what you
    do and it gives the other presenters credit. It shows you are in the
    know and ready to teach and learn instead of just telling people
    what you know.
* **Test suites** - instead of you telling people that something
    works, show them where they can test it themselves. This avoids
    people questioning you. All you do is share the results you found
    and what you make of them. Furthermore, you invite them to to do the
    same and find their own results to compare with yours. This makes
    the audience as cool as you, but you're still a bit cooler as you
    were the person they got that resource from. If they, for example,
    show their boss how slow their web site is and how to fix it,
    they\'ll remember you as the one who introduced them to the tool
    they impress their boss with.
* **Interactive examples and fork-able resources** - let them play and
    extend what you do. Put your code on JSBin, JSFiddle, CodePen or
    whatever other resources out there. Point to a GitHub repo. Make it
    obvious where to find your work and that you want people to use it
    for. Also ask them to give you feedback. Reusability and
    availability of code is important. Nobody wants to follow a
    recording of some live coding and trying to read the tiny code in a
    video.
* **Specifications and official standard discussion lists**. It is one
    thing to believe you as you are a speaker. It is a whole different
    game to know that something you talk about had a lot of expert
    eyeballs and got agreed on.
* **Collections of your resources**. Provide a link-list of the
    resources you talk about in your presentation and offer that as the
    one place to find it all. This avoids people having to note down
    what you talk about whilst you do it. It also allows you to use a
    short-url and track how many people looked up what you covered. This
    is a good metric to show to your managers.

One issue far too many people worry about is not being technical enough.
We all hate sales pitches - there's no doubt about it. A presentation as
a format has a lot of teaching benefits in comparison to coding
exercises. That's why you shouldn't feel bad for using a slide deck
instead of opening the Terminal as the tool of your presentation. Which
brings me to the most likely thing to eat into your time budget: code
exercises and live demos.

## Live coding?

I've had many discussions about this with other people doing developer
outreach. We see live coding as the most amazing level of awesomeness as
a technical presenter. It shows that you are still a coder. It shows you
walk the walk and not only talk the talk. It means that everybody can
repeat what you just showed.

Except, it doesn't. Don't get me wrong, I've seen amazing live coding
presentations. And they are always a big success with the audience. Some
presenters manage to make code a performance and keep it entertaining
and exciting. Those are exceptional people though, or the talk and the
live code has been extremely well prepared.

When asking the same excited audience members a few hours later what the
code was about or how the presenter solved a certain problem you get a
different picture. Live coding is exciting, but it also assumes that the
people in the audience work like you and use the same tools you do. Many
a time I've seen audience reactions getting off-track. People talked on
Twitter about the Terminal setup or the code editor the presenter used
rather than listening and reflecting on the topic of the talk. By coding
on stage, you allow people to get distracted by their pet setups and
ways to work and to show those off. It can be a major distraction. Or it
can even mean that people don\'t listen to you at all - after all you
don\'t use their environment.

Live coding has a lot of unknowns that can derail your talk and eat into
your time allotment. A lot of things can and will go wrong:
* **You will be offline** - don't believe anything conference
    organisers or venue owners tell you. As soon as you hit the stage,
    gremlins will get into the wiring and you will not be able to access
    online resources. This will also not be a binary state. Everything
    will look great right up to the point when it is needed. Then there
    will be a spinner and there will be nothing you can do about it
    except for re-starting the machine.
* **When speaking and writing you will add typos** - that's just a
    natural thing to do. It is charming when you admit and fix it
    immediately or when someone in the audience discovers your problem
    before you try it out. But, it costs time.
* **You will forget obvious things** - like your login details. Many a
    time I saw presenters trying to connect to a system and failed with
    three logins. One time I saw a speaker not realising he is in the
    name and not the password field and typed his password in for 2000
    people to see. Good luck fixing that issue.
* **Your code will be harder to write or not readable**. You have to
    bump up the font size a lot for people to see what you do and that
    means you have less characters to play with on one line. Often the
    resolution of a projector is not your standard one. This means, that
    the setup of your editor now has to fit in a much smaller space and
    you won't have all the menus and toolbars.
* **You can easily show things you don't want to**. Autocomplete on
    fields, browser history showing up when typing into the URL bar, all
    kind of things can become annoying or even straight out
    embarrassing. Many developers I know create a brand new profile on
    their machine for presenting to avoid this.
* **Debugging and problem solving costs time**. When something goes
    wrong on stage, you need to admit it and move on. When you just
    showed 10 minutes of code and the result doesn't work, you can not
    do that. That's when you start mumbling and concentrate on the code.
    Or you get lots of feedback from the audience in various states of
    helpfulness. In any case, it broke the flow of your presentation and
    time's ticking away. You lost control over your talk. And that\'s
    the one thing to avoid.

A lot of live coding is the "here, anyone can do this in one minute"
pitch, which can come across as tiring. As developers, we get promised
things that make our lives easier all the time. We also keep seeing them
fail. And we've seen a lot of "one minute demos" of things we never,
ever had to in our jobs afterwards. If it feels too simple to do, it
either isn't worth doing or it is insulting to our jobs as developers.
We're experts, and expert tools should make us build higher quality
products - not make us redundant.

That said, if you are firm in what you do and the conference is a
technical one where people expect things to break as they are
experimental - go wild. I'm not here to stop you from being as creative
as you can be in your own, personal way.

Consider doing screencasts of code and/or product demos and talk over
them. The reason is that talks should be repeatable and their content
reusable. Using a screencast, you can speed up the loading or
compilation parts of the video and you know the length of the exercise.
You can concentrate on coding and on stage you can concentrate on giving
a live commentary. Doing both is hard because typing something different
than you say is not natural.

## Avoid questions

One of the worst things to do during a presentation is to allow for
questions. I know, earlier in the book I said that's a good thing. But
that wasn't exclusively about conference presentations. While offering
the option to ask questions may seem like a great service to the
audience and makes things appear more interactive, there is not much
benefit to it. In a presentation that is part of a workshop to introduce
a part of the workshop, that's fine. At a conference, where you're on
stage and you have an allotted amount of time, it is nothing but
distracting:

* **You will have to listen to the question, understand it and then
    repeat it**. This is for the audience, but even more importantly,
    for the recording. On the recording you will look like a lost person
    trying to squint to see who asks and to hear and understand what the
    question is. Not a good look and not a great use of the time of the
    people watching your video later on.
* **The questions are either about things you will cover later, or
    about other topics, not directly connected with the one you are
    talking about**. The former makes you look smug when you say \"ah,
    that is coming later\". It also makes the time used for posing,
    understanding and repeating the question a total waste. It makes the
    one asking the question feel like he wasted everybody\'s time. The
    latter means the question disrupts your story and narration arc and
    distracts the audience. You lost them, and that\'s one main thing to
    avoid.
* **It is too cocky a thing to do**. Sure, allowing for questions
    during your talk shows that you are not afraid. It shows that you
    know everything there is to know about this topic. It also shows
    that you don\'t care much for your talk or that you haven\'t got a
    coherent story to tell. You already admit that your timing is not
    important and that you\'d rather have a discussion with people. Why
    not just offer an open Q&A instead of a talk then?

Make it obvious that there will be time for questions after the talk.
Tell people where to find you during the conference and how to contact
you. Re-assure people that your talk will have a lot of information to
come so that there is a good chance their questions will get answered.
In essence, show people that this is a planned talk with a fixed length
and they will be much more receptive and prick up their ears.

## Things to cut

There are a few things we consider good style to have in slide decks,
but are on closer inspection not as useful. They can work for you, but I
found cutting them had no ill effects in my talks:

* **Agenda slides** - this tells the audience when to sleep and when
    to stay awake. You can say what you will cover in one sentence at
    the beginning of the talk - no need to keep reminding people where
    you are at the moment. This feels like a crutch for the presenter
    and it gives the impression that you are not telling a story but
    follow an instruction sheet.
* **Corporate information slides** - \"I work for X, a company that
    does...\" is not what people came for. Unless your talk is about
    your company avoid this at all cost. That includes massive corporate
    branding of your decks. Unless there is a legal reason for that, cut
    that off. This is your time and how you fare makes people excited
    about your company. The problem with branding is that people have a
    preconception about brands. Don\'t let that be in the way of you
    becoming one.
* **Long-winded introduction slides about yourself**. That\'s what the
    bio on the conference materials is for, and - guess what? Nobody
    reads those either.
* **Current jokes and memes**. While it is cool to have those right
    now, they can look dated and in many ways even more contrived when
    people come back to your talk later. Even worse, what could be funny
    in the moment can become offensive in the nearer future when a
    certain meme or celebrity gets adopted by people you don't want to
    be seen associating with.

## Talk fillers

Once you are happy with your talk and you realise you have nothing to
remove, what can you put in to add value and fill up the rest of the
time? There are a few things that are important:

* **Tell people where to find the slides of your talk**. Hardly anyone
    ever looks at them but everybody wants them. This is always the
    first question in Q&A
* **Have a slide where to meet you and how to contact you**. Tell
    people why you use a certain channel and for what. Tell them how
    likely and fast you are to respond where.
* **Have a slide about colleagues or people you work with in other companies** that are experts on that topic. If you\'re busy, people
    can contact those.
* **Show where you are publishing and where your team is publishing things**. You don\'t want to be the only source of truth.
* **Show resources that cover the topic you talked about that need participation**. Mailing lists, repositories, unit test libraries
    and so on. In other words, show where the audience can become part
    of this in a simple and helpful manner.
* **Show resources you read to learn about that topic**. Sharing your
    sources is something people appreciate and it gives these resources
    a boost.

## Planning Your Talk Summary

Plan your talk around a central theme and single learning point you want
to get across. Add more around it to tell a story. That way you can
still take things out should you get less time to speak as your
predecessor used up too much. Your time is limited, the audience is not
listening to every word you say. Make it worth your and their while by
having great things to say, materials that help keeping the pace and
avoid those that can cost a lot of time when they go wrong. Murphy is
watching you. Cheat him by being prepared and offering longer Q&A if you
need to.

## Things not to say on stage -- and what to do instead

This is not about a post about trigger words or discriminatory
expressions. There is a lot of information about this available, and
even some [excellent linting tools](http://alexjs.com/) for your texts.
It is also not about unconscious bias. Or well, maybe it is. Learned
bias for sure.

This is a post about some sentences used in technical presentations that
sound encouraging. In reality they may exclude people in the audience
and make them feel bad about their level of knowledge. These are the
following sentences and I'll explain in detail how to replace them with
something less destructive:

* "This is easy..."
* "I'll repeat quickly, for the few of you who don't know..."
* "Everybody can do that..."
* "X solves this problem, so you don't have to worry about it"
* "As everybody knows..."
* "That's why Y(your product) is much better than (competitor) X"
* "This is just like we learned in school..."
* "This can be done in a few lines of code..."
* "If you want to be professional, do X"

None of these are a show-stopper and make you a terrible presenter.
There may even be ways to use them that are not confusing and
destructive. This is language, and in some cultures they may be OK to
use. I'm not here to tell people off. I am here to make you aware that
something that sounds good might make people feel bad. And that's not
what we're here for as presenters.

As a presenter your job is not only to give out technical information.
You also need to inspire and to entertain. Often you overshoot the mark
by simplifying things and trying to hard to please.

It is important to remind ourselves that we can not assume much of our
audience. The room might be full of experts, but the video recording is
also going out to everybody. Explaining things in a simple fashion is
not dumbing them down. It may actually be the hardest task there is for
a presenter.

It is stressful to be at an expert event. As an audience member you
don't want to appear less able than others. As a presenter, it is worse.
Presenting is a balancing act. You neither want to sound condescending,
overload the audience, make people feel stupid, appear too basic ...
and, and, and...

I've heard the following expressions at a lot of events and I always
cringed a bit. Often they are OK, and no harm done. But,to improve as
presenters it may be a good idea to be more conscious about what we do
and what effects it can have.

### "This is easy..."

We often try to calm down the audience by making what we show appear
simple. The problem with that is that what is simple for us might still
be confusing to the people in the room. Add peer-pressure to that and
people will neither speak up that they don't understand, nor feel
empowered. The opposite applies -- by saying something is easy and
people failing to grasp or apply it, we make them feel stupid. If you
make me feel stupid, you may inspire me to get better. But I don't do it
for the right reason -- I do it out of guilt and self-doubt.

The worst way to use "this is easy" is when you rely on a lot of
abstractions or tools to achieve the easy bit. Each of those could be a
stumbling block for people applying your wisdom.

**Replacements:**

* "Here are a few steps how to achieve this..."
* "By using these tools, which are all well documented, you can..."
* "The way to get this done is..."

Using these you send people on a journey. They don't tell them that the
end result is already a given. Who knows, they may find a way to improve
your "easy" one.

### "I'll repeat quickly, for the few of you who don't know..."

This expression fell at a conference I attended and it made me
cringe. The presenter meant to be encouraging in a "hey, we all are
already on board" way, but it can come across as arrogant. Even worse,
it already singles out those who do not know, and makes them feel like
they are under a spotlight.

If the intention is to do a quick intro on what you want to build upon,
it is better to phrase it as a reminder, not a "you already know, what
am I doing here".

**Replacements**

* "Just as a reminder, here is what X is about..."
* "As you may remember, X is about..."
* "We're building this using X, which is..."

This adds your repetition into the flow instead of being an excuse.

### "Everybody can do that..."

If everybody can do it, why do I listen to you? Also, if everybody can
do it, how come I never managed to? If you use this you either present
something basic, or you over-simplify a complex matter. The latter can
appear to be empowering; you take away the fear of approaching
something. But, it backfires when people can't use it. Then you exclude
them from "everybody". And that hurts.

**Replacements:**

* "If you know your way around X, Y and Z, you should find it easy
    to..."
* "Once you managed to do that, you'll find it makes the rest of your
    work easier..."
* "It is a very effective way to work, if it works for you, tell
    others about it"

This again makes it a reminder and a starting point of a journey. Not a
given that is redundant to repeat.

### "X solves this problem, so you don't have to worry about it"

Hooray for your product -- it solves everything. Now buy it and impress
people with wisdom you don't have. And feel worse when you get praised
for it. This is a classic sales pitch which works with end user
products. As a developer you should always worry about what you use in
your products as each part can become an issue. And it will be up to you
to fix it.

**Replacements:**

* "X solves the problems around Y, so you can build Z"
* "X was created to make Y easier and is used in production, the
    results are encouraging..."
* "Here are the steps you can do by hand that X does for you..."

Pop open the hood, show how your product works. Don't sell all-healing
remedies.

### "As everybody knows..."

Common knowledge is a myth and relies on your environment, access to
information, time to consume news and the way you learn. Presenting
something as common knowledge may make people think "so how come I ever
heard of it?" and stop them in their tracks.

**Replacements:**

* "This has been around for a while and was explained wonderfully in X
    (X being a resource you link to)"
* "Tests have shown that X is a given for a lot of solutions (point to
    research, give proof)"
* "I base this on the fact that X, as proven many times by... (and add
    a list a resources)"

"Citation needed" is a wonderful way to say something and prove your
point. You show people that you did your homework before you make an
assumption. And you give those who did not the tools to do so.

### "This is just like we learned in school..."

This assumes everybody went to a school with the same curriculum as you.
A lot of people have not. This is especially destructive when it applies
to knowledge that was part of a Computer Science degree.

**Replacements:**

* "This has been part of Computer Science teaching for years, and for
    good reason because \$x"
* "This should look familiar to anyone who went to a similar school as
    me, and for those who didn't, there's truckloads of information
    available online about it"
* "You might remember this from school -- now you see how it can be
    applied in a real job. Who knew?"

A lot of people create the web. Not all took the official path.

### "That's why Y(your product) is much better than (competitor) X"

This is common in advertising, especially in America. You show off your
product by making others look worse. This is pointless and only invites
criticism and retaliation by others. As a tech presenter, you should
know that the other product is also built by people. Final decision of
what gets shipped are not always based on technical merit. It is a cheap
shot.

**Replacements:**

* "Here's how to do that with product X, we took a different path and
    here's why..."
* "There are many solutions to this. We found that some were lacking a
    feature that made us more effective, which is X"
* "You can use whatever makes you happy to achieve X. We added the
    following, as we found it was missing..."

Showing you know about your competition prevents questions about it.
Showing how they differ allows people to make up their mind which is
better instead of you telling them and hoping they agree.

### "This can be done in a few lines of code..."

The amount of code has become a contrived way of showing how effective
our solutions are. Almost always the "quick and small solution" blossoms
into a much larger one once it is used in production. It makes much more
pragmatic sense to tell people that this is inevitable, and praise the
small starting point for what it is -- a start.

**Replacements:**

* "As you can see, starting this is a few lines of code. I simplified
    this to show here, the source code is available at X"
* "For now, this is all that is needed to achieve this. No doubt, you
    will need to add more to it, but it is a starting point"
* "By abstracting some of the issues out, we can cut down our code to
    a few lines"
* "As we rely on functionality of X, this means our implementation can
    be very small..."

A lot of times, this solves our own issue of showing only a few lines of
code on a slide. Instead, let's write understandable code that we
explain in sections rather than one magical tidbit.

### "If you want to be professional, do X"

People have different opinions what a "professional" is. Whilst we worry
about quality and maintenance, other people put more merit on fast
delivery. The state of the art changes all the time, and a sentence like
this can look silly in a few weeks.

**Replacements:**

* "X, Y and Z are using this heavily to deliver their products. Here
    are some case studies that show the positive results..."
* "Using X gives you a starting point you can rely on and makes it
    easier to explain to your replacement how to take over the
    product..."
* "The benefits of X are Y, which makes it a professional tool to
    use..."

You achieve professionalism with experience and by learning about new
thing and retaining them. Things people say on stage and define as "best
practice" need validation by professionals. It is not up to you as a
presenter to define that.

### A quick check

There are more unintentional destructive expressions. Read through your
talks and watch your videos and then ask yourself: "how would I feel
listening to this if I didn't know what I know?". Then remove or
rephrase accordingly.

Our market grew as fast as it did by being non-discriminatory of
background or level of education. Granted, most of us grew up in safe
environments and were lucky enough to have free schooling. But there are
a lot of people in our midst who came from nowhere or at least nowhere
near computer science. And they do great work. I'd go so far as to say
that the diversity of backgrounds made the web what it is now: a
beautiful mess that keeps evolving into who knows what. It is anything
but boring. There is never "one way" to reach a goal. We discovered a
lot of our solutions by celebrating different points of view.
