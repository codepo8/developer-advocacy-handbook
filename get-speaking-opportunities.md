# Get speaking opportunities

![A table with a lot of lanyards](images/lanyards.jpg)

Like any other skill, becoming a great public speaker means first and
foremost doing it a lot. Sure, you can read all about the art of public
speaking but the main trick is to get in there and overcome your fears
and uncertainties.

The crux is that it is not easy becoming a speaker at conferences. This
is partly based on the decision of most conference organisers to play it
safe and only use well-known speakers. This again is based on the fact
that audiences in surveys keep requesting well-known speakers and this
is -- sadly enough -- how we keep the speaker circuit from changing.

There is however a way out, which is to the most part based on getting
your name out there and using alternatives to conferences.

## Take part in podcasts

Podcasts have been blossoming lately and many people follow them on
their commute and on the go. Getting invited to take part in a
discussion or bring something to the news round of a podcasts is most
likely easier than getting invited to an event. However, it is a great
step on the way there. Listen to some podcasts, see what topics they
cover and how it meshes with what you want to talk about and you're
halfway there. Podcasters are always looking out for content and things
to cover and by reaching out to them and offering expert advice you do
not have to do the outreach work yourself but become known at the same
time. Getting invited is a process that happens a lot by word of mouth.
This means that by helping a smaller, up-and-coming podcast you do not
only help others but get onto the radar of the bigger players at the
same time. Often you meet podcasters at events. If you're flexible
enough to do a recording on the spot you'll soon find the first to
contribute to.

## Take part in panels

The same applies to panels. Whilst speaking slots are rare, panels, by
definition demand more people to be on them. Most presenters are
"panelled out" and don't want to be on them when they have their talk to
worry about. This is your chance to sneak on stage and get your first
experiences facing an audience. As you are not necessarily known
yourself yet, a good way to get invited to panels is to be a subject
matter expert or be part of a larger group (library creators, tech stack
enthusiasts...) and bring your expert knowledge to the discussion.

## Go to Grass Roots events

[Barcamps](http://barcamp.org/) used to be a really great
counter-movement to the conference circuit, and to a degree are still
around. They are un-conferences, meaning they are gatherings of
enthusiasts of networking and presenting. Unlike conferences they are
free and one of the really interesting [rules of Barcamp](http://barcamp.org/TheRulesOfBarCamp) is that everybody who attends also has to give a presentation.

These presentations are normally 15 minute slots and can be about
anything that gets you excited at the moment. I\'ve seen the full range
of technical talks at barcamps but also knitting tips and gardening
advice.

Barcamps and similar grass roots events are great opportunities to get
your first experience in public speaking and allow interested people and
conference organisers to spot you as an upcoming talent. Often you will
find events like these organised around other events. For example,
[Indie Web Camps](https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamps) or
[a11ycamps](http://www.a11ycamp.org/).

## Go to Meetups

[Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/) are informal gatherings of people in
the business to chat about hot topics and generally meet and get to know
other local peers. Often have a quick presentation slot to start the
event and this is your chance to get a foot in the door and have an
expert audience (or actually an audience of experts that are not the
normal conference crowd) to speak to.

Often local IT companies that want to get known organise meetups in
their offices, and whilst this means you need to be cognisant of their
agenda it is a good place to get to know that company and maybe even
offer you as a guest speaker.

## Write articles

A lot of conference organisers also run online magazines. These change
over time but there are always some big players out there you should
easily find. The benefit of an online magazine for conference organisers
is that they can keep the buzz going in-between events and try to build
a community around their brand. This is a great opportunity for you. Not
only can you hone your writing skills, but you get known right at the
source for talk opportunities, too.

Offer to write articles for magazines and keep a look out for article
writing competitions and you\'ll find yourself invited to speak faster
than you think.

## Offer Brownbags

Brownbag presentations mean that you offer to come to a company during
their lunch break and give a presentation. In case you are wondering --
that\'s where the name comes from -- as Americans bring their lunch in
brown paperbags.

Brownbag presentations are a great opportunity:

* **They are not that common** -- so offering them to a company makes the person agreeing to it an innovator. A lot of companies have them on their radar but find a hard time to fill them with internal presenters
* **They mean that you reach people** that normally don\'t go to conferences but have quite a big word-of-mouth power or work in a large company that does a lot but isn't loud about it
* **Your presentation is not disruptive to the daily deliveries** of the company but adds extra value to a normal break.
* **They don\'t mean much traveling** as you can do them at local companies (granted, living in a hotspot makes it easy).
* **You get on the company\'s blog and extranet** and via that known to their clients and partners.

## Ask questions at conferences

One idea to plant in your head is to **never be shy to ask questions at
any meeting or conference**. I am a hundred percent sure that my success
in my job had its main breakthrough after I asked detailed technical
questions to the speakers at the \@media2005 conference.

I had spent four months arguing with my boss to get tickets to the
conference and that it is important for my team to go there and wanted
to get my money\'s worth -- and everybody going to conferences should do
the same.

If you don\'t ask you don\'t get an answer -- it is as simple as that.
If your question is technically valuable and interesting you can be
quite sure that the rest of the audience had the same problem, but were
too afraid to ask.

## Be a presenter people want to invite -- publish your presenter terms

Imagine yourself as a conference organiser. You have to deal with a lot
of people and juggle a lot of things. Who are you more likely to invite?
A presenter you need to email every few days to get information, or
someone you can easily work with?

One of the biggest winners with conference organisers I had was that I
have my [presenter terms](https://codepo8.github.io/presenter-terms/)
listed in full detail online. These are on GitHub and I invite you to fork them and use them as your own presenter portfolio.

In these, I listed all the things conference organisers kept asking me
about:

* A short, up-to-date bio
* Headshots/Photos to use
* All the important personal information (name, location, job title, social media names, homepage)
* Videos of other talks / other presentation slides

I also listed in just the right amount of detail

* What I can do for an event
* What topics I prefer to cover
* What my show-stoppers are -- things I won't do and I don't want to support
* What I will deliver at the event
* My technical setup -- what stage technology I need
* What I expect of a conference organiser
* Financial agreements (I normally don't ask to be paid, but my travel to be covered and the cost of a normal speaker fee to be used for free diversity tickets)
* What can go wrong and how I will deal with it

Thinking these things through doesn't only help conference organisers,
but it is also a good opportunity to focus what you want out of events.
You don't want to be seen as someone who doesn't know what they want.
You want to be a professional presenter happy to deliver a good talk but
also expecting a professional surrounding.

Having all this information out of the way and available as a simple
link for copy + paste, the only thing left a conference organiser who
chose you will have to do is to sort out the date and get a title and
abstract of your talk. This might not seem a lot, but having to chase
this information with even only 10 presenters at your event really eats
into your time budget.

By being prepared you can save a potential conference host for your talk
a lot of time.

Getting invited to speak is a cumulative process. The more you present,
the more likely you are to get invited again. Use any presentation
opportunity also as a networking and advertising opportunity. Other
presenters, organisers and even conference partners all talk to each
other and share opportunities to present. Becoming known as someone
helpful, nice and easy to work with goes a long way there.
