# Work with your own company

As a developer advocate you will find that a large part of your work is
dealing with internal colleagues and unpredictable changes to your
company.

This can actually be a much harder job than dealing with the outside.
The reason is that people on the inside have both more information about
and a different relationship to the products you advocate.

That can mean that whilst the outside world is excited about a certain product,
people on the inside aren't proud of it at all. And getting praise for a job
you considered not done well isn't a good feeling. It makes you feel
like people don't appreciate your efforts at all.

The journey towards releasing a product can be painful, frustrating and sometimes plain
confusing. For example, highly successful products can bleed money.
That could lead to a lot of frustration in the company as other, more
lucrative or efficient products don't get the same resources.

Your job as a developer advocate is to listen to people on the inside,
understand their problems and communicate with management to try and
fix these issues. You also need to ensure that you remind people of
facts instead of chiming in with bad rumours. What the outside world
says about the company and products might not necessarily be the real
picture.

Frustrated people are likely to say bad things about their company
on social media and elsewhere. That isn't only a problem for your
products but could also be a bad move for their career. Often you will
find yourself being a sounding board for the frustrations of the people
building products and a mentor to keep them from saying things
publicly they may regret later. It is important to build up a reputation
as someone people can vent at about their work without repercussions.
This also is an important step to validate the worth of the developer
advocate position to developers. After all, you are their advocate,
right?

> **Tip:** Seeing a tech company fail is an excellent thing for online media
outlets. It causes outrage and brings a lot of clicks. Tech companies
are still seen either as "too clever for normal people" or "probably
downright evil and arrogant". As it is pretty easy to look up online
where someone works any ill-advised word from a colleague -- or from you
for that matter -- can and will become quotes like "Company X employee
said..." which gives an attack to your company more gravitas. Do not
fall into that trap and make sure that you don't let frustration get the
better of you or your colleagues. Keep repeating that you are there for
them to talk about frustrating parts of their work.

There are a lot of things you have to be aware of when you are a
developer advocate. One of them is the enemy within the company.

## Prepare for prejudice

You have a unique role which spans various traditional roles. Especially
for developers moving away from the day to day grind can easily be seen
as betraying the cause. Prejudiced developers are amazingly proud of
being the delivering part of the company and consider anyone who does
not code superfluous. I am sure you met these people and heard
statements like "I don\'t know why we need designers, when we use a
framework!". It is somewhat ironic that the people whose standing in the
company you try to improve are the ones that are likely to be opposed to
your role.

In the end, this is something you will have to live with. You will burn
a few bridges and you will have to suffer a lot of internal and external
abuse and nagging but it is important to keep your eyes on the goal. If
exclusively working as a web developer for 12 years has taught me one
thing then it is that delivering awesome work pleases first and foremost
yourself. In order to have an impact in the company and to get things
changed you have to take your hands off the keyboard and start talking
and persuading.

Don\'t get discouraged by people seemingly stabbing you in the back
-- in reality this is exactly the miscommunication and lack of people
skills that you try to help out with. See it as a challenge and not as a
show-stopper. Once you can show successes of improving the standing of
developers in the company you can go back and ask what they think of
your role now. Most of the time this is not necessary any longer though
as the terribly grumpy people either left the company or others start
telling them to stop. You can't please everybody -- you are not pizza.

## Deal with company changes

As the IT market is constantly changing so do the companies in it. This
can be a great thing but in most of the cases it will mean that you have
to deal with issues that are beyond of your control. Mergers,
acquisitions, new products, products being discontinued, rounds of
layoffs, redundancies - all of these things happen, so be prepared.

> **Fact:** The sad fact is that most company changes don't have anything to
do with the quality of your work. The concept of shareholders buying
into a company because they believe in it has been dead for years - it
is all about trading stocks and moving them to make money in the
process. This means that most smaller companies have three months time
to turn any new product into a massive success as this is the time in
between shareholder meetings. If there is no immediate success then the
product gets canned and the people on it with it. This is a terrible
state of affairs and it leads to mediocre and short-win driven products
instead of great, lasting experiences. And the latter is what good
developers are all about.

The thing about you being a developer advocate is that you are in the
spotlight of the world and the company so you\'ll be the first to be
asked about an opinion when there is a big change in your company. This
can have disastrous effects - either you violate a company policy and
tread hard on the toes of your legal, HR, marketing and PR team or you
sound like a company drone to the developers in the company. Here are a
few things to be aware of:

* **Every change in the company has a legal process** - while you are not an official press channel to the outside world your statement can be misquoted (oh and it will) and get you into legal trouble with your own company - liaise with PR and legal as soon as possible when there is a change. Then tell the developers in your company the legal implications.
* **There is no "off the record"** - neither internally and especially not when you are talking to the press/bloggers/outbound channels.
* **Switch to listening mode** - during the first few hours after a dramatic change listen to everybody and keep your eyes and ears open to what people say. This helps you to stop people from completely destroying their professional standing in the company and the market and to learn about what is really happening. Don\'t be part of the noise that drowns the facts.
* **Don\'t act emotional and make assumptions** - almost any change in the company will annoy people. In the heat of the moment this can lead to dangerous comments, assumptions and truisms which will come back to haunt you a week later. Be aware of this and don\'t fall into the same trap. Instead be ready to bail these people out later on. Get the facts and before you say anything have a backup that can verify what you are saying.
* **Make your knowledge level clear** - if people ask you what is going on don\'t say "no comment" as that implies you know something but are not allowed to say it. Simply state that you are not in a position to know yet but that you are investigating.

> **Tip:** This last point is important. As your job is to communicate
with everybody in the company people already assume that you know a lot
more than they do. As developers get paranoid
about changes in the company this can mean that people think you know
all about what annoys them but hold back as you are siding with "the
company" or "the management". Don\'t lose your contact with and the
trust of the developers in the company over something you have no
control over.

> **Example:** One interesting example of a change was when in one round
of redundancies a broadly liked and respected outgoing and
extremely talented developer got made redundant. The developer was also
part of a team that built one of the most important products at the
time. The mailing lists where flaming, people were tweeting about the
unfairness of it all and in general everything pointed towards the
company having completely lost its marbles. Speaking to HR I got to
learn that the reason he was picked was that in a previous round of
redundancies he had filed for voluntary redundancy and naturally these
were the employees who were picked first. In addition to that talking to
the developer himself I found out that he was totally OK with the
decision and looked forward to having more time to look after his pet
freetime projects and turning them into businesses. All the emails and
comments going out failed to either address the developer himself or HR
for a statement and this resulted in an avalanche of misinformation and
bad blood.

## Be there for internal developers

You traveling the world and seemingly spending your work time aimlessly
surfing the web and posting on social media can give a wrong impression
of you losing interest in being a developer. Work around that by not
losing the connection with the people in your company that build things
and listen to what they do.

> **Tip:** Don\'t get bogged down in detailed problems of other developers
though. You should be a voice of reason, understanding and pragmatic
solutions and you can only be that if you see the work being done from a
vantage point.

More importantly, listen hard when developers feel hindered in
delivering their job. Then talk to their management about these
problems. Keep these talks anonymous and show the impact these problems
have on delivery, employee retention and quality of the products your
company builds.

Any change for the better you can cause and any work improvement that
can be attributed back to you allow you to not be part of the delivery
and still keep your tech credibility. You achieve this by talking in the
right language at the right time to the right people. Developers are
always asked to deliver yesterday what is defined in a week\'s time and
never feel the chance to voice their concerns. Make them aware that you
can be their spokesperson and that you are there to demand time for
discussing problems with their managers.

> **Example:** I was touched when one of my former colleagues asked me to
have a few late night phone calls (over Skype) to talk about his future
in the company and an offer he had from another company. I was also very
annoyed about how frustrated he was about not feeling any joy or
empowerment in his job. The reason was that he didn\'t dare talking to
his manager. My main question in these calls was how he feels about
going to the office every day and he said that he dreads it. The
decision was clear: **if you do not like going to work and you don\'t
feel you have a chance to cause any change - leave**. He is now in a new
role in a different company, feels excited about the challenges
there and left the company not in anger but with a feeling of
accomplishment and knowledge that there are caring people in his old
company and not only the ones that made him leave.

## Work with PR and marketing

As stated in detail beforehand, your role as a developer advocate means
that you are in between classic outreach departments like PR and
marketing and developers. The danger there is that these departments
could see you as competition.

Therefore it is immensely important that you keep on good terms and in
constant communication with these departments. The reasons should be
obvious:

* **You don\'t want to give mixed messages** - different views, yes, but you should both at least promote the same products to different audiences.
* **PR and marketing know legal implications you don\'t** - so make sure you chat with them before prematurely releasing information or promoting products that are about to change drastically.
* **These departments have already established communication channels** which can give you a good way in to speak at conferences and work with the press.
* **You can learn from their experience** - most probably these departments will have people that are on the job longer than you have been and can predict patterns.
* **You can feed back state-of-the-art developer information** - validating the impression PR has of a new product with realities makes sure that over-ambitious advertising doesn\'t promise developers functionality that you\'d have to explain is not available yet.
* **Sharing contacts can open doors** - you might have a way into companies and publication channels that PR always wanted to have but couldn\'t find.

Only by liaising with the other outreach channels of the company you can
make sure that you give the same message. You don\'t want to be seen as
a threat.

## Be known as an outward channel

As a lot of people talk about the company to the world on different
levels it is a good plan to tell the company about your outward
communication channels. This ensures that you are not approaching the
same people in parallel and possibly give mixed messages effectively
undermining your and your company\'s credibility. It also shows the
company that you are a person that reaches where they can\'t. List all
the places where you publish:

* Blogs
* Magazines (print and online)
* Mailing lists
* Forums
* Conferences
* Professional groups and bodies
* Social networks
* Podcasts
* Newsletters
* Live channels

Also make sure to tell people that you have invite codes and accounts
for products (if you have them of course). This works a treat and stops
people from having to sign up themselves if they just want to have a
look.

## Train other advocates and developers

Just like forward thinking developers share as much of their knowledge
with other developers you should plan for training people in the company
to do what you do. The reason is the same in both cases: you can share
the workload and you can be sick or take a holiday. Another thing you
can do is target new ideas and spend time on other plans what to do with
your (professional) life.

There is also the benefit that people that are not like you might have a
lot more impact in different channels. If you're an mid-career developer
advocate some of the fast paced new communication channels might feel
alien to you and you'd stand out like a sore thumb there. Some of your
younger colleagues might actually already use the hot new channel and
with a bit of guidance can do much better there than you could ever do.

**Training advocates is a tricky thing** - by definition advocates
should be found and empowered and cannot really be "made".

Just like you use your powers of communication and persuasion to bring
products to developers you can use them to bring potential advocates out
of the woodwork:

* **Make the company aware of the communication channels** to the outside world. Say that the blog you have is successful and that you are happy to publish in-depth blog posts about current work and best practices used in the company. Then offer help with writing those. Prove that by giving a social media channel a more human voice more people will follow it than the ones that are basic news announcement channels of the brand.
* **Tell the company about events** - both the ones you organise and ones that happen in the area. This is especially necessary when you can\'t attend them. Offer to support a developer who wants to go with free goodies to give out (stickers, shirts...) - if they go and bring back photos and information how it went to write a blog post together.
* **Offer specialised internal training and talks** - as the prospect of developer advocacy might still be alien and even scary to people cut the training offer down to things that can be applied in any professional role: writing for the web, public speaking tips, finding great web content (well, basically the different chapters here).
* **Share great responses from the outside world** - send out for example a newsletter of "happy social quotes" with tweets and blog posts about how a certain event or product launch was received in the developer world.
* **Ask people to challenge your products** - run some internal competitions to collect ideas about how people in the company would like your products to change. In a few companies I worked had we had "hack days" for that and more and more companies start doing the same.

> **Tip:** A lot of this will tie in nicely with communication channels that
PR and marketing already use. Ask them for help instead of doing your
own thing and creating confusion and trespass on their territory.

## Share useful technology

As a developer advocate, you will have the hand on the pulse of
technology. Not everybody has the time to keep up the same way -
actually hardly anybody has. That\'s why an interesting part of your
job is to communicate great technology finds with your company.

If you find great tools that make everybody\'s life easier, share them
with the company. This can include things like screenshot tools to stop
people from sending you Word documents with embedded resized bitmaps,
translation tools, communication tools, automated social media
collateral generators - anything that you use to save time every day.

> **Example:** One thing you will find is that if you are an early adopter of
technology the main market will get to know some of them a few months
later. During my career I had great success helping marketing to set up
blogs or newsletters and HR to use Twitter. This creates an amazing
amount of goodwill with these departments and it is an easy step for you
as you are already excited and knowledgeable about these technologies.

## Balance your personal and official channels

One issue you will face sooner or later as a developer advocate is where
to put your information. The big mistake there is to use your own,
personal channels (blog, Twitter account, YouTube channel, Facebook page
and so on) for everything. This is tempting to do, for several reasons:

* **You control the timing and style of the publication** -- it is your profile...
* **It aids your personal brand** -- people come to you to find out cool, up to date technical info
* **It is lucrative** -- you can make some extra money by showing ads or getting other sponsorships

This is how a lot of personal social media presences work, and well at
that. The issue, however, is that once you publish for a certain company
you are not just \"you\" any longer. You are a translator and a voice of
a certain company or product and -- more importantly -- the people
working in or on it. That\'s why it is a bad move to use your own
channels as the source for company or product specific information. For
various reasons:

* **You limit yourself** -- by posting about a certain company or technology you become the person to cover that technology. You have to answer comments you can not answer but the people working on the technology can. You set yourself up for an endless game of telephone. What happens when you leave the company or move on to another product?
* **It will cause discontent** -- whilst it is good that you use your fame to promote the work of your colleagues, you also get benefits (tangible in the form of advertising money and lesser tangible in the form of fame) by writing about the work of other people. You didn\'t do the hard work, you didn\'t attend the meetings, you didn\'t work extra hours to meet deadlines yet you become the face of the project. This can be seen as ripping people off.
* **You cause a disconnect** -- your channels are not where the product is built and maintained. What happens when the technology changes? Keeping the information close to the subject matter and maintained by the people who work on the product ensures that things stay up-to-date without your intervention.
* **You miss out on internal promotion** -- an official blog or repository of your company is promoted by the marketing department and everyone in the company. People know it as a channel and are excited to see new and up-to-date, well produced information there. Your own blog might not be known to people in the company and is not seen as a trustworthy channel as it is not in control of the company. You could go rogue any time, or your blog could be hacked. Official channels will shy away from promoting your work with you.
* **You cause a massive maintenance overhead** -- it is up to you to keep the posts on the subject up-to-date when changes to the product happen. You might not be with the company any longer when changes happen and you don\'t want to have to deal with questions by people years later when \"your product\" out of a sudden changes.

All in all, the balance between publishing on your own channels and
company official channels is simple: publish detailed information tied
to the product where the product is maintained -- a company wiki, an
official blog maintained by the company, the GitHub repository and
similar places. That way you can move on to another company without
leaving confusion and a mess behind. It also ensures that web searches
in the future find a maintained resource, and that social media updates
don\'t end up in a missing page -- the company has a stake in keeping an
official resource available. As an advocate, your job is to raise the
profile of the company creating the product you promote and the product
itself. Thus the official pages with the up-to-date information should
show up higher in search results than your own blog. Otherwise you
failed at doing your job. You are a pointer, a transmitter -- not a
replacement.

What you publish on your own channels should whet the appetite of your
readers to go to the official place and learn more. This could include
translations, a quick screencast, screenshots, a nice demo using the
technology (instead of being it). Think of your company\'s product as a
movie and you are the one who cuts and releases the trailers in various
places to get people excited about it.

There is a fine line between promoting your company\'s work and
taking credit for it. Don\'t cross it and you\'ll help the company and
keep being a trustworthy resource and communication channel.

## Remove the brand

One crucial part to becoming a successful developer advocate is to
remove the brand from your thinking.

Yes, you work for a certain company that builds a lot of products, some
of them cool -- some of them terrible. The point of developer advocacy
is not to get people excited about the brand or the company behind it
though. It is about the products the company releases and even more
specifically about getting developers excited about playing with them.
Your goal as a developer advocate is to get developers to talk about
your products and promote them for you. This is why you need to try your
best to remove yourself from the brand of your company to set an
example. This is tough. The larger and more known the company you work
for is, the more people will try to paint you as "the company X person".
We'll deal with this later in the book, but it is something to prepare
yourself for.

Separating yourself from the brand and towards the product only works
when you are excited about the product. If the department that builds
the product fails to get you interested in the product, don\'t talk
about it -- instead, work with the department to find the thing that
makes it worth while for you. Anything you advocate should answer one
simple question: **What is in it for developers?**

The products you advocate need to get you excited and you need to know
where they are going and who to ask for detailed information about them.
If the product has no internal stakeholder or team that is a danger
sign.

People working on products are actually not the right people to advocate
them -- they are far too close to the subject matter to find obvious
flaws in the documentation. They are also fine with overly complex functionality
as they are used to it. This goes as
far as having their own language. Every product I worked with used
specialist terms that in day-to-day conversation made sense to the team
but would be cryptic gibberish to put in a blog post.

Your job is to offer them a way to translate this into easier
understandable documentation and examples and challenge their current
state of affairs. You do however need them to do a good job so be
careful not to burn any bridges by being too critical. People spent a
lot of time building what you want to tell the world about and are
protective about it.

The real power of removing your brand goggles is that you will be able
to work with rather than against the competition.
