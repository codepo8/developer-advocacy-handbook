# About this handbook

This handbook will get you on the way to be a great developer advocate
for any product or company. Naturally, your approach may need tweaking for
different markets and audiences - and in accordance with your own
personality - but the main principles are the same for everybody and
anywhere in the world.

Developer advocacy is a comparatively new field of work and the first
hurdle you will encounter is people asking what a developer advocate is
and why any company would need a role like that.

Fifteen years ago I wrote this book for exactly that reason. I had hit a
wall in my career as I was lead developer and the next and only role to
get higher up the ladder for me was manager, which I didn't want to do.
I already had started reaching out to developers about my company, but
there was no recognition for it internally or it plain and simply wasn't
my job. This is why I came up with the idea of "developer evangelist"
not only as a good idea, but as a full time job in a technical company.
Lucky for me, the company agreed that it would be a beneficial thing to
do. That's why I wrote this handbook to help other people to get the
same option.

# About this version

Fast forward to now. I had a long career as a "developer evangelist" in
a few companies and this handbook has inspired a lot of people to go the
same route. Developer Relations (DevRel) with all its different roles is
a much more common market and many companies have taken on the ideas
outlined here and it the follow-up books and posts and videos that
followed. There are dedicated mailing lists, communities and even
conferences that don't only feature DevRel people but are all about
DevRel.

Naturally this brought a lot of change along the way. I also stepped
back from the role of plain Developer Relations and went into Program
Management, because I found it time to let other people bring in their
ideas and skills that speak to a newer audience.

When I got approached to release a print version of this book, I took a
look at it again and found it at times quaintly outdated, speaking about
now defunct tools and products, but the general message and ideas still
valid. Even more so, that in a world where you can drown in an avalanche
of information about developer advocacy, I took a "zoom out" approach
and concentrated on what you should consider and achieve and not the how
and which products to use to get there.

I also took a deliberate renaming approach from Developer Evangelism to
Developer Advocacy. The reason is that Evangelism is a religiously
loaded term, whereas advocacy has a nicer ring to it. You are the
advocate for the developer world -- the voice to the outside and the
person asking for great developer experiences inside your company.
