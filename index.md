# The Developer Advocacy Handbook

![Chris Heilmann presenting at dotjs 2019 with a slide saying developers are people](images/cover.jpg){:height="1024" width="683"}

This handbook will get you on the way to be a great developer advocate
for any product or company. Naturally, your approach may need tweaking for
different markets and audiences - and in accordance with your own
personality - but the main principles are the same for everybody and
anywhere in the world.

## New version 

This is a new, 2020 version of this 11 year old book and I added quite a few new chapters and removed outdated materials. You can read more about this in the [about section](about).
