# The Developer Advocacy Handbook

![Chris Heilmann presenting at dotjs 2019 with a slide saying developers are people](images/cover.jpg)

This handbook will get you on the way to be a great developer advocate
for any product or company. Naturally, your approach may need tweaking for
different markets and audiences - and in accordance with your own
personality - but the main principles are the same for everybody and
anywhere in the world.

This is a new, 2020 version of this 11 year old book and I added quite a few new chapters and removed outdated materials. 

If that is of interest to you, you can start choosing from the [table of contents](toc) or [reading the book](what-is-developer-advocacy).
